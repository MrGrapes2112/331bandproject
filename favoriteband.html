                Ghost is a swedish metal band. They are known for their rather unusual appearance and act on stage. The lead singer wears skull makeup, 
                and performs alongside the band's anonymous members, known only as "nameless ghouls", who all perfom in identical attire and masks. The band 
                features unique and impressive sound albeit some rather explicit lyrics found in most of their discography.
